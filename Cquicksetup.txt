FILENAME=/Users/brianmendoza/Desktop/Sequences/test2spCas9.txt
REGION OR KEGG CODE=(1,500,1000)
OUTPUT FILE PATH=/Users/brianmendoza/Desktop/Sequences/

NOTES
-For the FILENAME please use the complete file name of the CASPER_Seq_Finder output file (entire path starting with C:/ on Windows, /Users on Mac)
    Example: /Users/brian/Desktop/CRISPRs
-For the REGION OR KEGG CODE if you would like search multiple regions or genes, separate these by semicolons
    Example Regions: (1,500,1000);(2,350,748)
    Example KEGG code: sce:YBR046C
-Output file path is where the results of CASPERQuick will appear
    Example: /Users/brian/Desktop/
-You may change the OFF TARGET ALL field to "TRUE" but this is not recommended unless you have a very small (<100bp) region you are investigating
